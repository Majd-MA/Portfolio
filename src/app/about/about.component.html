      <h3>
        Born and raised in the historic city of Damascus, Syria, I hold a degree in Software Engineering from the Faculty of Information Technology Engineering at Damascus University, which I earned in December 2024.<br><br>

        As an experienced software developer, I have had the opportunity to work on diverse projects using a wide range of technologies. My expertise is focused on backend development, where I specialize in building robust, scalable systems and maintaining complex infrastructures. <br><br>

        With a deep understanding of both the software engineering process and backend development, I am skilled in managing all aspects of a projectâ€”from initial planning and design to seamless implementation and optimization.
